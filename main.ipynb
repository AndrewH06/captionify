      "1408,img/insta1408,\"MY NINE MOST IMPACTFUL MOMENTS OF 2019 1.) when i pulled my hamstring twice and started turning into thanos... then raged my face off in Ibiza for two weeks and made it 10x worse. - 2.) the passing of a young legend. Kong Da Savage was kidnapped & eaten by a coyote. This was the last pic we ever took. He was so soft & so dumb & he‚Äôll always hold a special spot in my heart. If you‚Äôre a coyote and you‚Äôre reading this, im coming for you üèπ - 3.) adoption of a new legend, the world‚Äôs greatest looking husky. I try to emulate this dog‚Äôs energy. He‚Äôs always happy, ready for adventure, and eager to please. My new best friend. - 4.) when i slapped a man into the 8th dimension & realized i DIDNT want to fly to Russia and enter the International Russian Slapping Contest. May seem obvious but this was a big growth moment for me in realizing that Life > Content. - 5.) When we trolled the entire world & infiltrated the flat earth community under the guise that I, Pogan Laul, believe the earth is flat. Don‚Äôt be f**king morons. - 6.) the death of the most iconic bird in history: This little sun conure was my GUY since high school, before Vine. He was eaten by who is currently at Bad Dog Camp. Maverick became a martyr as he continues to emblazon apparel on people across the world. - 7.) extending our family at the Watts Empowerment Center. We brought a Winter Wonderland to kids in California who have never seen snow. I love these hooligans. - 8.) We‚Äôve been saying it, but the world finally caught up... was awarded ‚ÄúPodcast of The Year‚Äù at the 2019 awards. Holy sh*t this show has changed my life & people‚Äôs perception of me. - 9.) THE FIGHT... after becoming a professional boxer & three months of a grueling fight camp, I unfortunately came up short. Sort of. We sold out the Staples Center, made internet history AGAIN, & became one of the most successful boxing events on I‚Äôll likely have two fights next year, 1 MMA and 1 Boxing. - Final notes: I didn‚Äôt suck that dick (sorry?) Team Maverick is doing 2020 sober 2020 is the year of the girlfriend Two points was bullsh*t \"\n",

This little bird inspired so much of what I do, he was my best friend, he‚Äôs the inspiration behind the icon worn proudly by millions of people around the world, and as bizarre as it sounds, this little parrot‚Äôs legacy will live on FAR beyond his life. I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here or how to handle this because it‚Äôs symbolic to me in so many ways, but for all the Mavericks out there who continue to see life through the lens of possibility, who continue to persevere and embrace their differences, I have never-ending love and optimism for you.

      "4244,img/insta4244,\"I LOVE THIS! Please read this. small people will always bring you down. \"\"I got to spend these last 2 days doing nothing but therapy appointments. After speaking to a middle school today one of the girls asked me doesn't it make you really tired? My answer was no actually the quite opposite. What gets tiring is sitting all day. Not moving and being in one spot, that makes you tired. When I leave therapy after a couple hours of giving it all I got, I feel more alive than anything. I thank God for these appointments and pieces of equipment and hands on deck that move my body. You know, as I sit here and think to myself, I want to encourage you to just try and be grateful for even all the little things. To try and think of all the small things that have carried you through. To enjoy all of the moments. To find those things, whether few or many, that give you a sense of purpose. It's different for all of us. And isn't that the coolest part? That we are all so different yet searching for the same thing? It blows my mind. Don't let people bring you down, small people do that. Find those ones that want to lift you up, those that want to carry you on their journey of success. So you too can carry people on yours. Whether it's a mistake, tragedy, loss, or just life running it's course that has brought you to the here and now, I hope you can find peace in your current circumstance. I hope you go to bed tonight and wake up tomorrow morning ready to attack the day with enthusiasm. Even if it carries grief, let that grief fuel your greatness ‚ú® past mistakes | paralyzed\"\" \"\n",

      "4426,img/insta4426,\"Wow this story! Thank you \"\"The first photo was taken when I was at my lowest weight, 69lbs. The photo next to it is one of my recent photo shoots. I'm Christina. I've been blessed with incredibly supportive friends and family. Lately, things have been amazing. But there's been multiple times where things haven't been. I was born with congenial pulmonary lymph angestia; a rare lung condition that at the time of my diagnosis, there were 20 people in my state that had ever had it. At the time of my diagnosis, the disease had a 97% morality rate in infants. I weighed 3 pounds and 6 ounces. My lungs weren't fully developed and they were filled with mucus. I was in the ICU for about six months before I was able to go home. At home, I had a heart monitor for my younger years, as well as frequent hospital trips caused by extreme difficulty breathing and physical developmental issues. When I was 16 until I was 19, I had to drop out of high school and become homeschooled because I got so sick. I couldn't keep food down (the mucus in my stomach was affected as well, which we didn't know about.), I couldn't breathe, and I was 69lbs. I was so depressed and suicidal because I felt so terrible constantly. Waking up was hell. I was on about eight medications and eventually had toxic shock from all the medicine. Eventually, they found out that digestive enzymes helped and a treatment that finally started working for me. At my lowest points, I was heavily involved in self harm. I have post traumatic stress disorder from my time in and out of the hospital. I have nightmares about being in there. I lost a lot of my friends and my self confidence plummeted. I couldn't look in the mirror without crying, and truly thought that I would be better off dead and that people would be happier without such a lieability. The depression and anxiety still fights me. I'm not always put together. And my disease flares up, a lot, usually at inconvient times. But my illness and my past. We are all more than what we seem. Everyone has their struggles, so be mindful and be kind\"\" \"\n",

      "4510,img/insta4510,\"a victim of rape. I'm a survivor. This is my story. With domestic violence being such a big issue in Australia at the moment. I thought I would share my story in hope that it will inspire at least one person to get help. I was with my ex partner for just over a year, things were great..at the start. Until he got addicted and started to rely heavily on the drug crystal meth. That's when things started to get abusive and extremely violent and I started to lie to my friends that I wasn't seeing him, because they knew how abusive he was. I had to cover marks and bruises with make up. I refused to believe that he was an unstable person, and believed that I could change him, but I couldn't. One day we went out to a club and he drugged me, I woke up tied to a bed and was gang raped by him and 7 other people. He made me believe that I deserved the abuse and I would take it. Towards the end of the relationship he called me telling me to go to his house because there was some type of emergency. I went and found him having sexual intercourse with another male. That should have been the end of it right? Though a couple weeks later he texted me saying to meet me at his house because he wanted to apologise for everything that he did..stupidly I went, as soon as I arrived he grabbed the back of my head and smashed it into a brick wall, whilst choking me he forced himself on me. I didn't tell my parents about the abuse until about a year later, and told my friends that I managed to get him off me because that's what I wanted to believe. Though no one should be ashamed of domestic violence and rape. It's never your fault and you should always speak up and help is out there. If you have experienced and are going through something similar, please don't hesitate to seek help. If you would like support and someone to talk to don't hesitate to call BeyondBlue support service on 1300 22 46 36. If you are in an emergency call 000 straight away and ask for police. Never think your alone and help isn't available. Your not a victim your a survivor. depression, anxiety, PTSD. \"\n",

I was struggling through my parents divorce and a really bad breakup. It led to anorexia which was one of the hardest things in my life to overcome so far. I was so skinny, if I laid down, you could see and feel my organs in my stomach. At the same time I was dealing with so much anxiety and depression that I could not even think straight. I hope no one ever has to go through the same struggles as myself. Because of my anorexia my family became concerned for me and instead of them trying to find help for me, they just pointed out my obvious weight loss to the point where I would feel even worse about myself. All these issues caused me to become extremely ill by my junior year and I was hospitalized 4 or 5 times that year do to malnutrition. Something snapped in me by the end of my junior year to the point where I just had to change myself or my life was going to go down the drain. I have gained my weight back to 120, but now I have to go through the struggle of people pointing out my weight gain, they are mostly good comments, but I still struggle at seeing myself at the weight I want to be. I look at pictures of myself from 4 years ago and say \"\"man I was skinny then\"\" and then I have to remind myself, no I was unhealthy. Trying to see myself as healthy is hard, but I am thankful for my friends who helped me out of the bad place I was in. I hope this helps others who are struggling with similar issues as mine.\"\" \"\n",

I left my comfort zone many, many times this year and I kept going, my faith in brighter days never faltering. Being different physically is complicated, you have to deal with loads of shits, and still keep smiling. I want to say to anyone who feels different, lonely or just down, You never know what tomorrow is made of, in good or bad, so please, keep going and Life is weird, so are we, and that's what is I decided to embrace my flaws a long time ago, and I never regretted once that decision. I'm a young artist, and once again here, it's hard being different because, judgments (\"\"you can draw with your hands?\"\") but it's worth it. I believe one day, I will work for making her cds covers, and even make exhibitions in San Fran, Amsterdam and Tokyo. In meantime I'm gonna build my empire, one drawing per day. And because life is worth living no matter what. I love life. Do \"\n",

I just wanted to share you my story for those who doesn't know what I have! - I have a hairloss which is called Alopecia is a Hair Loss, my immune system kills my hair follicles which makes me lose my hair on my body. Ive had it since I was one years old! So it's been basically my whole life that I've had it. I remember in kindergarten I'd get bullied for wearing a hat a lot and getting teased thru elementary as that girl who was bald. It really hurt me that people everywhere would look at me differently. Thru out the years I've gained confidence slowly. I started wearing a wig in 6th grade til Junior year of high school. - I decided to start a Instagram the beginning of my junior year of high school, towards the end of junior year I've gained so much confidence to go to school without my wig, Trust me guys I was so scared to face my biggest fear. But guess what! it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Everyone supported me and accepted me for who I am. On social media I had the best supporters ever! To support me and make me happy!! I don't even know what'd I do without you guys and my family and friends. Just a thank you guys for being apart of my life. I'm so grateful to make you guys happy with my positive thoughts and my YouTube videos üíú I hope my story tells you that you shouldn't hide who you really are! You must embrace your flaws, just be yourself, and be happy!! I just want to change the world to make it a better place, and to make you all happyüíú just a girl who was looked differently. I love you guys üòò (ps. Your smile could make another persons day)\"\" \"\n",

It is estimated that in Australia alone 45% of the popular with experience a mental health continue through their life. Twice as many young people die from suicide then road accidents. For years and years I suffered with clinical depression. Dropping out of school in year 9 and being in and out of hospital for over 10 months. The demons were real and at the time I really did not want to be alive. I never thought it was possible to be happy again, or leave the small country town I was at. I was failing at school and for years my anxiety and depression ruled my life, how I felt. Who I spoke to, my eating habits, the way I saw my self, how I saw others. It consumed me in every possible way. You have got to find what you love in life and I cannot stress that enough. Since leaving dungog and moving to live on the lake with Lawrence for the last 2 years I have been off medication and absolutely loving and thriving of life! Every day is a blessing. Since starting 8 months ago, I am a changed person. I smile, I love life. I want YOU to know you are more then what your depression tells you, you are worth more then a blade to your skin, you are beautiful and you deserve to be in this world, other wise you would not of been born. Find your passion and your mission and infuse them both into your daily work, let your determination drip from you. I hope can notice this, and share this as I know more then half her followers would of or would be suffering from depression. And together we might just save a few life's! \"\n",

      "4726,img/insta4726,\"Beautiful Johnny \"\"So I'm gonna share my burn story :D so the reason I look like this, is a pretty long story, hopefully Instagram will give me enough room to type it xD okay well here. November 20th 2003 I was playing in the backyard with my sister Joanna. We had this hay loft fort we made in the shed. And we had no flash lights, so we got a candle & match, brought it into the shed so we could have some light. So my sister leaves to use the bathroom or whatever, and I climb to the top of the fort. I call Max our dog, and he comes running in the shed, jumps on the loft the candle was on. And it falls over. By the time Max got to my lap, I was already surrounded by fire. My sister comes out and screams at me to jump. But I'm too scared because it's too high, and there was fire below me. So Joanna (age 7) comes running to get our older sister Leah in the house, who was baby sitting us, but was doing homework with my brother Luke at the time. So Joanna screams at Leah (older sister) JOHNS TRAPPED IN THE FIREY SHED AND CANT GET OUT! So Leah runs outside. She was holding her baby, so she put her baby on the ground and asks Joanna where I am. So Leah holds her breath and shuts her eyes, and runs in the fire, she can't find me so she runs back out. Takes another's deep breath etc, she finds me, but she doesn't know why I'm so heavy. It's because max was on me. So she pulled me off the fort outside. I'm not breathing, and Leah screams please God let him breathe! I gasp for breath, I'm brought to le bonhuar (sorry can't spell that hospital xD) they say I only have 8 hours to live. But then Shriners hospital came, took me in a helicopter to Galveston TX.then put me in a coma for 6 months or something like that lol okay well my past, I look at this accident as blessing, because if it never happened, I wouldn't be the strong confidant person I am today. Oh yeah there was way more emotional healing than physical. But I pulled through :D ^^ so ya burnsurvivor awareness must be spread :3 \"\n",

So , at 3 months old i was given up for fostering due to my birth mother having addiction problems during her pregnancy with me. I was fostered for about 6 months and then adopted at 8 months . Growing up was hard for me because as a young boy in primary school trying to explain why i had two family trees and two \"\"tummy mummies\"\" was tough as i myself didn't really understand what that meant. After many awkward and tough encounters with family members I decided to tell one of my closet friends my story. This was when i was entering high school. This person decided to tell others my story and this destroyed me. Everyone knew and was bothering me and teasing me and I felt so isolated. This led to years of bullying and trying to hide myself ,me being insecure and angry . I used to get so angry and confused and just wanted to be normal . So frustrated with the concept of trying to blend in. I was obsessed with the idea of being normal and this led to me retreating into myself , building walls in my friendships so i didn't get hurt so easily . Adoption is such an amazing thing and personally I feel like there isnt enough publicity for me and my fellow peers that are adopted . THIS IS THE REASON IM DOING THIS . I want people that are adopted to know I UNDERSTAND YOU AND ITS OKAY! . Recently ive learned that what others tell me i am. And that my insecurities and my struggles. I am so blessed to have this life I live and have realised that God has got my life all planned out. I want to just say BE YOU , don't live for anyone else. Be happy, be confident and love yourself. Thank you for reading üìã‚ú®\"\" Thank you for sharing this very inspirational and beautiful. \"\n",

I am also blind in my left eye. I went through most of my life feeling ashamed of how I looked. It wasn't until my late twenties that I learned to love myself just as I am. No one is perfect. We all have things that we would like to change about ourselves, but remember this- because you are here, you are worthy of love, happiness and human dignity. There isn't anything you need to do to earn your worthiness. It is your birthright. For so many years, I felt like I had to work a little harder to get people to see past my condition and connect to the real me. Now I see that this was never true. People have always seen the real me when I dared to show up and be present. What I know for sure is this: people see you too. Even when you feel invisible. Even when life knocks you down. If I can make peace with how I look, you can make peace with your insecurities. The world is waiting for you to show up in all of your glory. Will you answer the call?

So make the most of it now, before it all changes once again, because in the near future, all of this is going to be just a memory. \"\n",

Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney‚Äôs case. We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms. We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime - especially one punishable by death - deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered. So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay! \"\n",

      "8206,img/insta8206,\"Today we celebrate my mom. Anyone that knows her, knows how sentimental she is. For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn‚Äôt where we would be eating. I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home. All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It‚Äôs where each Kardashian child was born and made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper and kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings, decor out of the same fabric and print as the wallpaper. We had lunch at the home as if it hadn‚Äôt changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned. I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked. I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever.

I‚Äôm proud to partner on this initiative with , a company with a history of taking bold action to do what‚Äôs right for our community. Thank you for providing ride share credits to formally incarcerated people when they come home. If there are any other companies who would like to step up, we would welcome the support.

Let‚Äôs talk about the transfer. I‚Äôve been using body makeup for over a decade now and in my experience you either get coverage that doesn‚Äôt transfer but it‚Äôs super dry and looks fake or its the opposite and really moisturizing but completely transfers. My new Body Makeup is in between. If you let it dry before putting your clothes on it transfers way less and if you set it with a translucent powder it hardly transfers at all. It was important to keep the skin looking flawless yet natural. Swipe to the 3rd slide to see. In the transfer video we didn‚Äôt have translucent powder but tried one of my pressed powders and that worked pretty good too! My body foundation really evens out and corrects your skin tone and conceals veins and bruises. My formula is super creamy, hydrating and long lasting!

      "8491,img/insta8491,\"Last year I registered with the California State Bar to study law. For the next 4 years, a minimum of 18 hours a week is required, I will take written and multiple choice tests monthly. As my first year is almost coming to an end I am preparing for the baby bar, a mini version of the bar, which is required when studying law this way. I‚Äôve seen some comments from people who are saying it‚Äôs my privilege or my money that got me here, but that‚Äôs not the case. One person actually said I should ‚Äústay in my lane.‚Äù I want people to understand that there is nothing that should limit your pursuit of your dreams, and the accomplishment of new goals. You can create your own lanes, just as I am. The state bar doesn‚Äôt care who you are. This option is available to anyone who‚Äôs state allows it. It‚Äôs true I did not finish college. You need 60 college credits (I had 75) to take part in ‚Äúreading the law‚Äù, which is an in office law school being apprenticed by lawyers. For anyone assuming this is the easy way out, it‚Äôs not. My weekends are spent away from my kids while I read and study. I work all day, put my kids to bed and spend my nights studying. There are times I feel overwhelmed and when I feel like I can‚Äôt do it but I get the pep talks I need from the people around me supporting me. I changed my number last year and disconnected from everyone because I have made this strict commitment to follow a dream of mine - It‚Äôs never too late to follow your dreams. I want to thank Van Jones for believing in me and introducing me to Jessica Jackson. Jessica along with Erin Haney have taken on the role of my mentors and I am forever grateful to them both putting in so much time with me, believing in me and supporting me through this journey. This week I have a big torts essay due on negligence. Wish me luck ‚ú®‚öñÔ∏è \"\n",

I visited prisons, met with formerly incarcerated people, and helped with cases of individual injustice - including two death penalty cases. I have met with and am very supportive of Governor Newsom and his decision to help bring an end to the California Death Penalty. Racial bias and unfairness run deep throughout the justice system but especially when it comes to the death penalty. And we should not be okay with the risk that an innocent person could be executed. I hope we can turn toward better solutions that focus more on healing victims of trauma and prioritizing fairness and justice. \"\n",

      "10127,img/insta10127,\"I guess you saw the attention my last post received. The FDA has told Duchesnay, Inc., that my last post about Diclegis (doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine HCl) was incomplete because it did not include any risk information or important limitations of use for Diclegis. A link to this information accompanied the post, but this didn‚Äôt meet FDA requirements. So, I‚Äôm re-posting and sharing this important information about Diclegis. For US Residents Only. Diclegis is a prescription medicine used to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who have not improved with change in diet or other non-medicine treatments. Limitation of Use: Diclegis has not been studied in women with hyperemesis gravidarum. Important Safety Information Do not take Diclegis if you are allergic to doxylamine succinate, other ethanolamine derivative antihistamines, pyridoxine hydrochloride or any of the ingredients in Diclegis. You should also not take Diclegis in combination with medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as these medicines can intensify and prolong the adverse CNS effects of Diclegis. The most common side effect of Diclegis is drowsiness. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or other activities that need your full attention unless your healthcare provider says that you may do so. Do not drink alcohol, or take other central nervous system depressants such as cough and cold medicines, certain pain medicines, and medicines that help you sleep while you take Diclegis. Severe drowsiness can happen or become worse causing falls or accidents. Tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Diclegis can pass into your breast milk and may harm your baby. You should not breastfeed while using Diclegis. Additional safety information can be found at www.DiclegisImportantSafetyinfo.com or www.Diclegis.com. Duchesnay USA encourages you to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. \"\n",

First of all i would like to apologize for posting that hurtful instagram post, at the time i thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive.. I have to be honest though it was my caption and post that I screenshoted of scooter and Kanye that said ‚Äútaylor swift what up‚Äù he didnt have anything to do with it and it wasnt even a part of the conversation in all actuality he was the person who told me not to joke like that.. Scooter has had your back since the days you graciously let me open up for you.! As the years have passed we haven‚Äôt crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, hurts or frustrations. So for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on scooter isn‚Äôt fair. What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was to get sympathy u also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter. Anyway, One thing i know is both scooter and i love you. I feel like the only way to resolve conflict is through communication. So banter back and fourth online i dont believe solves anything. I‚Äôm sure Scooter and i would love to talk to you and resolve any conflict, pain or or any feelings that need to be addressed. Neither scooter or i have anything negative to say about you we truly want the best for you. I usually don‚Äôt rebuttal things like this but when you try and deface someone i loves character thats crossing a line.. \"\n",

      "14300,img/insta14300,\"I don't know about these award shows.. No disrespect to anybody at any of the shows or the people running it. Nothing but love for you guys and your support. But I don't feel good when I'm there nor after. I try to think of it as a celebration but can't help feeling like people are rating and grading my performance. A lot of people in the audience there to be seem worried about how much camera time they will get or who they can network with. When I'm doing a regular show I feel they are there for the right reasons and to strictly have a good time! But these award shows seem so hollow. I get the premise is to award people for their accomplishments, but is it really? Because when I look in the audience I see a bunch of fake smiles so that when the camera hits them they look happy. Sure there are people truly proud of others so I don't want to knock them I'm just looking at the vast majority. I just think to myself if I'm living my purpose I want the reward to be fulfillment. I'm getting awarded for the things that I'm doing and not for who I am which is understandable I know it would probably be hard to calculate and award someone's spirit lol. But When I do get these awards the temptation of putting my worth in what I do is so hard to fight!!!I am privileged and honored to be recognized by my peers in but in these settings I can't feel the recognition. There's an authenticity missing that I crave! And I wonder does anybody else.. Sorry not sorry about grammar it's not my strong point \"\n",

I wanna enjoy life and not be a slave to the world and their demands of what they think I need to do!! I love the fact that I am able to make people happy but cmon if you truly were in my position you would understand how tiring it is ( boo hoo Justin get over it) I'm going to keep making decisions I feel are fit for my growth and no human being will make me feel bad for it. \n",

My family is beyond proud, and nothing's been said by them, my grandparents wouldnt know how to reach to press even of they did want to so that was a lie and rehab cmon. if Anyone believes i need rehab thats their own stupidity lol I'm 19 with 5 number one albums, 19 and I've seen the whole world. 19 and I've accomplished more than I could've ever dreamed of, i'm 19 and it must be scary to some people to think that this is just the beginning. I know my talent level and i know i got my head on straight. i know who i am and i know who i'm not My messege is to to believe. My albums could be about anything but my messages have been to never say never and believe, not to believe in me but to believe in yourself .. I honestly don't care if you don't believe in me because I believe in me, my friends believe, my family believe, my fans believe, and look where that's gotten me so far.. I'm writing this with a smile on my face and love in my heart. Letting u know first hand how I feel rather than have these story linger. I'm a good person with a big heart. And don't think I deserve all this negative press I've worked my ass off to get where I am and my hard work doesn't stop here... All this isn't easy. I get angry sometimes. I'm human. I'm gonna make mistakes. In gonna grow and get better from them. But all the love from you guys overcomes the negativity. I love u. Thanks \"\n",

      "17351,img/insta17351,\"üåàHAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!!üåà While we have so much to celebrate, we also have a great distance to go before everyone in this country is truly treated equally. In excellent recent news, the House has passed the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools, and other public accommodations. The next step is that the bill will go before the Senate. I‚Äôve decided to kick off Pride Month by writing a letter to one of my senators to explain how strongly I feel that the Equality Act should be passed. I urge you to write to your senators too. I‚Äôll be looking for your letters by searching the hashtag While there‚Äôs no information yet as to when the Equality Act will go before the Senate for a vote, we do know this: Politicians need votes to stay in office. Votes come from the people. Pressure from massive amounts of people is a major way to push politicians towards positive change. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve created a petition at change.org to urge the Senate to support the Equality Act. Our country‚Äôs lack of protection for its own citizens ensures that LGBTQ people must live in fear that their lives could be turned upside down by an employer or landlord who is homophobic or transphobic. The fact that, legally, some people are completely at the mercy of the hatred and bigotry of others is disgusting and unacceptable. Let‚Äôs show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally. üåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåàüåà Click the link in my bio to sign the petition for Senate support of the Equality Act. \"\n",

      "17424,img/insta17424,\"I‚Äôm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I‚Äôll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I‚Äôve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! üó≥üòÉüåà \"\n",

It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve dealt with since I was a young teen and has caused me to feel anxious, helpless and insecure. As humans, I don‚Äôt think we share our insecurities enough because we live in a time where being ‚Äúperfect‚Äù is the standard. We curate our life online and pick the pretty moments to post. I‚Äôd like to show a younger generation that not everything is perfect. Being insecure about my acne gave me thick skin but I wouldn‚Äôt ever wish that feeling upon anyone so after trying countless options, I found something that has been helpful in maintaining clear skin for me. It‚Äôs been a long journey but I‚Äôm excited for where my skin is now. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see the day where I would feel confident posting a makeup free picture. My goal is to open up a dialogue around skin positivity. ‚ù§Ô∏è \"\n",
